Hi,
In this main.py we have created 4 methods under a class name "ipl_match"
1) def table_data(self) -> This method consist of the Table data which is stored as an array using numpy modulue
2) def table_output(self) -> This method is to display the table data in a Tabular Format using Tabulate modulue
3) def consecutive_loss(self) -> This method is to display the Team name which has 2 consecutive loss
4) def n_loss_win_points(self) -> This is a generalized method , that we could get teams that have n consecutive
losses/wins & Calculate the average points of these filtered teams.

"s_obj" object was created for the class "ipl_match"
using the above object , methods were called.
Thank you.
